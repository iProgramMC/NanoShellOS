# NanoShellOS - Ignored Files

# Ignore resource compiler executable
/tools/rc

# Available at https://github.com/NanoShellOS/sm64
# Won't integrate into the repo even as a submodule because:
#   1. It requires source Z64 files which I won't provide for obvious reasons
#   2. It would break `make -C apps`
# So you're left on your own. But don't worry! It's pretty easy to compile:
#   Step 1. Check out the sm64 repo at apps/sm64:
#           `cd apps && git clone https://github.com/NanoShellOS/sm64.git sm64`
#   Step 2. Paste in your preferred baserom. Default is the US version.
#   Step 3. Type `make -j` (or `make -j VERSION=xx` if you aren't using the US ROM)
# Note: This actually integrates nicely with the NanoShell build system so you
#       can just `./tryapp.sh sm64` and it'll just work. Be aware that this will
#       use the latest regional version you've compiled.
